# AI-Assisted Development: GitHub Copilot and Beyond

GitHub Copilot represents a paradigm shift in software development. AI can now assist with code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

## Using Copilot Effectively

```javascript
// Copilot suggestion - API endpoint
// prompt: create REST endpoint for user registration
app.post('/api/auth/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  const user = await User.create({ email, hashedPassword });
  res.json({ userId: user.id });
});

// Copilot suggestion - unit test
test('should register user with valid credentials', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/api/auth/register')
    .send({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'secure123' });
  expect(response.status).toBe(201);
});
```

## Prompt Engineering

```
Good prompt: "Create a React component that fetches and displays a list of users with pagination"
Bad prompt: "Make a component"

Result: Copilot generates complete, well-structured component with proper hooks and error handling
```

## Cautions

- AI-generated code needs review
- Security vulnerabilities can be introduced
- Code quality varies significantly
- Not all suggestions are optimal

Copilot is a powerful tool that amplifies developer productivity when used thoughtfully. The future is AI-assisted, not AI-replaced.
