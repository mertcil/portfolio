# System Design Patterns: Building Scalable Architectures

Good system design anticipates growth and handles complexity. Understanding core patterns is essential for building systems that scale.

## Load Balancing

```
Multiple Requests
       ↓
Load Balancer
    ↙  ↓  ↖
Server 1, Server 2, Server 3
    ↘  ↓  ↙
  Consistent Response
```

## Caching Layers

```
Application → Cache (Redis) → Database
                ↑
            Store frequent queries
```

## Database Replication

```
Primary Database (Write)
        ↓
    Replication Log
        ↓
Replica 1, Replica 2 (Read-only)
```

## Message Queues

```
Producer → Message Queue (Kafka) → Consumer
                  ↓
            Persistent storage
            Decoupled systems
```

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private failureCount = 0;
  private state: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open' = 'closed';

  async request(fn: () => Promise<any>) {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      throw new Error('Circuit is open');
    }

    try {
      const result = await fn();
      this.failureCount = 0;
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.failureCount++;
      if (this.failureCount >= 5) {
        this.state = 'open';
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

Good system design is about understanding trade-offs: consistency vs availability, latency vs throughput, simplicity vs features.
