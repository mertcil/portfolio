# Microservices Architecture: Scaling Beyond Monoliths

As systems grow, monolithic architectures become bottlenecks. Microservices decompose applications into independently deployable services.

## Service Boundaries

```
Monolith:
[All business logic in one codebase]

Microservices:
[User Service] [Order Service] [Payment Service] [Inventory Service]
     ↓               ↓                  ↓              ↓
  Database A    Database B        Database C    Database D
```

## Docker Containerization

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Service Communication

```javascript
// REST API calls between services
const orderService = {
  async createOrder(customerId, items) {
    // Call inventory service
    const inventory = await fetch('http://inventory-service/check', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ items })
    }).then(r => r.json());

    // Call payment service
    const payment = await fetch('http://payment-service/process', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ customerId, amount: total })
    }).then(r => r.json());

    return { orderId: 123, status: 'confirmed' };
  }
};
```

Microservices enable teams to work independently and scale services based on demand, but complexity increases significantly.
