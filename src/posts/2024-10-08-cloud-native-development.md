# Cloud-Native Development: Building for AWS, Azure, and GCP

Cloud-native applications are built to take advantage of cloud platforms' strengths: elasticity, managed services, and global distribution.

## AWS Serverless Example

```javascript
// AWS Lambda Function
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const body = JSON.parse(event.body);

  const result = await dynamodb.put({
    TableName: 'users',
    Item: {
      id: generateId(),
      name: body.name,
      email: body.email
    }
  }).promise();

  return {
    statusCode: 201,
    body: JSON.stringify(result)
  };
};
```

## Infrastructure as Code

```yaml
# Terraform for AWS resources
resource "aws_lambda_function" "api" {
  filename      = "lambda.zip"
  function_name = "my-api"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.arn
  handler       = "index.handler"

  environment {
    variables = {
      DATABASE_URL = aws_rds_instance.db.endpoint
    }
  }
}
```

Cloud-native architecture enables rapid scaling, reduced operational burden, and cost optimization.
