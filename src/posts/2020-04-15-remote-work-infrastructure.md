# Remote Work Infrastructure: Building Tools for Distributed Teams

2020 changed everything. Overnight, we shifted from office-based teams to distributed teams globally. This required rethinking our infrastructure and tools.

## VPN and Network Security

```yaml
# OpenVPN Configuration
port 1194
proto udp
dev tun

ca ca.crt
cert server.crt
key server.key
dh dh.pem

server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0

# Push DNS to clients
push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"

# Enable compression
comp-lzo
```

## CI/CD for Remote Teams

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          aws s3 sync ./dist s3://${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET }}
          aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${{ secrets.CF_DIST_ID }} --paths "/*"
```

## Monitoring Remote Systems

```typescript
class RemoteSystemMonitor {
  async checkTeamHealth() {
    return {
      apiHealthy: await this.checkAPI(),
      databaseHealthy: await this.checkDatabase(),
      servicesHealthy: await this.checkServices(),
      uptimePercentage: await this.calculateUptime()
    };
  }
}
```

Key lessons: Automation, monitoring, and clear communication became more critical than ever.
