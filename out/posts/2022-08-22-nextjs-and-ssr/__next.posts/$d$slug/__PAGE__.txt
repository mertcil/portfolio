3:Te62,<h1>Next.js and Server-Side Rendering: Building Modern Web Applications</h1>
<p>Next.js revolutionized React development by providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out of the box.</p>
<p>The framework now spans the entire stack: React Server Components for data fetching, streaming layouts for progressive rendering, and middleware for request-time personalization. When paired with a component library and TypeScript, Next.js offers a cohesive developer experience from ideation to production deploy.</p>
<h2>Static Generation</h2>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// pages/posts/[id].tsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  return {
    paths: posts.map(post => ({ params: { id: post.id } })),
    fallback: 'blocking'
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id);
  return { props: { post }, revalidate: 3600 };
}

export default function Post({ post }) {
  return &#x3C;article>{post.content}&#x3C;/article>;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>API Routes</h2>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// pages/api/users/[id].ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    const user = await getUser(req.query.id);
    res.status(200).json(user);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next.js combines frontend and backend in one seamless framework, dramatically improving developer experience.</p>
<h2>Incremental Adoption and Performance Budgeting</h2>
<p>Modern Next.js apps lean on incremental static regeneration to keep content fresh. Set <code>revalidate</code> windows based on business needs—news sites might choose minutes, while product catalogs can stretch to hours. Use the built-in <code>next/image</code> component to optimize media and apply the <code>app/</code> directory’s layout nesting to share expensive data fetches across routes.</p>
<p>Client performance still matters. Measure Core Web Vitals, audit bundle analyzer output, and lazy-load interactive widgets behind the <code>'use client'</code> boundary judiciously. Edge runtime functions and middleware give you the power to personalize at the edge without boomeranging back to the origin server.</p>
<h2>Operational Excellence</h2>
<p>Define a deployment pipeline that runs linting, type checks, and Playwright smoke tests before pushing to Vercel or your platform of choice. Capture metrics on build times and cache hits so you know when it’s time to refactor or split bundles. Teams that invest in observability for SSR—monitoring response times, cache status codes, and error rates—spot regressions before customers do.</p>
<h2>Internationalization and Accessibility</h2>
<p>Next.js simplifies internationalization (i18n) with routing and locale-aware data fetching. Combine it with translation management platforms and fallback messages so localized content remains fresh. Accessibility (a11y) must remain central—use automated checks in CI, run audits with tools like Lighthouse, and involve assistive technology users in usability testing. Inclusive design pays dividends in global reach and regulatory compliance.</p>
<h2>Collaboration Between Disciplines</h2>
<p>Successful Next.js programs align product designers, accessibility specialists, performance engineers, and DevOps. Shared Storybook catalogs, design tokens, and component libraries keep implementations consistent. Hold regular design+engineering reviews to vet layout nesting, streaming behavior, and perceived performance. Collaboration turns the <code>app/</code> directory into a playground for experimentation instead of a source of tech debt.</p>0:{"buildId":"YAj4gSoDaYA4ButsZzxgu","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"title":"Next.js and Server-Side Rendering: Building Modern Web Applications","date":"2022-08-22","author":"Mevlut Mert CIL","category":"Frontend Framework","tags":["nextjs","ssr","ssg","performance"],"htmlContent":"$3"}],["$L4"],"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
